Analysis and Prediction of Covid-19 Mutation Rate


Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, genetic strains of SARS-CoV-2 have emerged and circulated all over the world. New Covid-19 variants continue to occur due to genetic mutations globally. Large volume of Thymine (T) and Adenine (A) are mutated to other nucleotides for all regions, however codons do not mutate as frequently as nucleotides. In this project, we are going to calculate the mutation rate of nucleotide sequence and codons and then implement Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) model, Vanilla Recurrent Neural Networks and Gated recurrent units(GRUs) to predict the future mutation rate of SARS-CoV-2 virus.
